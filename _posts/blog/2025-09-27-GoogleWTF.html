Hello, i am back screaming into the void about android platform stuff again,
<br>
it has been nearly a month now as of writing (27-09-2025 18:00:00 BST) since google released Android 16 QPR1 to Pixel devices, and it is still not available in AOSP.
<br>
if you go to <a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/">cs.android.com</a> and look at the AOSP branches, you will only see for Android 16 '16.0.0_r1' and '16.0.0_r2', both of them are from the (QPR0) release in June.
<br>
now, normally we would have r10 or r15, but according to my sources (GrapheneOS), there has been no tags since June because google decided to change the frequency of security updates from every month to every quarter, that is a dumb idea, and google has not pushed QPR1 (or the security patches) this month
<br>
the mastodon thread where i found out this information, was from 11th September 2025, nothing has changed since then
<br>
we already had a scare earlier this year, when more android development moved to inside google, we were told that AOSP would not be discontinued, i fear that we were lied to.
<br>
this 'delay' has been too long, google, come on, just push the code already.
